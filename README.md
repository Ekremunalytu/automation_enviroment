ExTrace is a VS Code extension analysis platform built around three runtime
surfaces:

- A FastAPI API for catalog ingestion, activation report access, marketplace
  download, and sandbox analysis.
- A Dockerized executor that runs full VS Code GUI sessions under Xvfb and
  drives them with Playwright.
- A Vite + React + Tailwind analyst console that consumes the API and
  visualizes activation reports and live simulation jobs.

## Operating Model

ExTrace is intentionally designed as a single-user sandbox appliance, not a
multi-tenant web platform.

- Backend, UI, PostgreSQL, and executor are expected to run on the same machine
  or inside the same Docker host.
- The primary deployment shape is a local or lab sandbox where one analyst
  inspects one extension at a time.
- Background analysis is intentionally limited to one active job at a time.
- Activation reports remain file-backed operator artifacts under `output/`,
  while async analysis job metadata is persisted in PostgreSQL.
- If the API process restarts during an active analysis, that job is marked
  failed and should be rerun.
- ADR 0007 local-network-binding is Accepted **and implemented (W8-7,
  `2026-04-29`)** — `appcore/api/config.py` defaults bind `127.0.0.1`,
  CORS allow-list replaces the wildcard, every `docker-compose.yml`
  `ports:` entry carries an explicit `127.0.0.1:` prefix, and host-side
  CDP exposure is gated behind the Compose `debug` profile. To expose
  services on the LAN, follow `documents/runbooks/lan-exposure.md` and set
  `EXTRACE_ALLOW_LAN=1` (host-mode `make dev-lan`) or edit the compose
  file directly.

## Current Phase

- W4 stabilization, W5 detection foundations, W6 automation hardening, and
  W7 PoC acceptance are all closed (last closure `2026-04-23`).
- Post-W7 hardening (`2026-04-24`) landed reliability + modularization
  follow-ups (fatal UI-crash fail-fast, scan-between VS Code restart,
  `attribution/` subpackage split, `sim-target` Makefile lane).
- Post-W7 simulation UX + reliability (`2026-04-25`) landed weighted
  simulation progress, full-stack analysis cancel flow, the VNC harness
  ready-marker fix, and the `t1-demo-runnable-canary` fixture + rule +
  `make demo-canary` lanes.
- PR345 target activation lifecycle is complete as of `2026-04-27`; PRs 1-5
  plus ADR 0006 target output-channel capture landed on
  `feat/pr345-completion`.
- W8-0 deterministic harness readiness gate landed on `2026-04-27`, unblocking
  W8-1 and W8-3.

## Current Architecture

The refactor introduced a canonical split between shared platform code and
workflow code:

- `appcore/`
  - Shared platform modules.
  - `api/`: settings and FastAPI dependencies.
  - `db/`: SQLAlchemy engine and session factory.
  - `storage/`: ORM models and CRUD helpers.
  - `contracts/`: shared Pydantic v2 schemas.
- `packages/`
  - Framework-agnostic contracts and analysis logic.
  - `analysis_contracts/`: backend-owned analysis contracts, activation
    reports, trigger payloads, and detection DTOs.
  - `analysis_planner/`: trigger planning logic.
  - `analysis_engine/`: reserved extraction surface for shared analysis logic.
- `workflows/`
  - Business workflows grouped by capability.
  - `extension_catalog/`: extension ingestion, parsing, and catalog endpoints.
  - `activation_reports/`: reads JSON activation reports from `output/`.
  - `marketplace/`: Marketplace search/download and sandbox analysis.
- `executor/`
  - Sandbox runtime.
  - `control.py`: workflow-visible sandbox boundary.
  - `container/`: Docker image, entrypoint (`start.sh`), and the shared
    `launch_vscode.sh` script used at boot and by scan-between resets.
  - `flows/playwright/`: Playwright automation helpers, package-mode
    `entrypoint/`, `monitor/` facade, attribution/scenario/runtime-capture
    packages, and focused helper packages for health, stimulus, workspace,
    VS Code UI, and signals.
- `ui/`
  - Primary analyst-facing React SPA built with Vite and Tailwind.
  - `src/app/`: shell and route composition.
  - `src/features/`: `evidence`, `marketplace`, `reports`, `rules`,
    `settings`, `simulation`, `system`.
  - `src/lib/`: API client, adapters, generated contract types, and shared
    frontend helpers.

The repository now uses canonical imports only:

- Shared platform modules live under `appcore/`
- Framework-agnostic analysis logic lives under `packages/`
- Workflow code lives under `workflows/`
- Workflow-visible executor control lives under `executor/control.py`

## Request Flows

### Static Catalog Ingestion

`POST /createExtension`

1. `workflows.extension_catalog.router`
2. `workflows.extension_catalog.service`
3. `workflows.extension_catalog.manifest_reader` +
   `workflows.extension_catalog.manifest_parser`
4. `appcore.contracts.schemas`
5. `appcore.storage.crud`
6. PostgreSQL

### Marketplace Download

`POST /api/marketplace/download`

1. `workflows.marketplace.client` downloads and extracts a `.vsix`
2. `workflows.extension_catalog.service.create_extension_from_directory`
3. `appcore.storage.crud` persists validated manifest data

### Sandbox Analysis

`POST /api/marketplace/analyze` or `POST /api/marketplace/analyze/start`

1. `workflows.marketplace.router`
2. `workflows.marketplace.analysis_service`
3. `workflows.marketplace.job_service`
4. `executor.control` boundary
5. `executor.host` Docker exec wrapper
6. `python -m executor.flows.playwright.entrypoint`
7. Reports written under `output/`
8. Async job metadata persisted in PostgreSQL `analysis_jobs`

Notes:

- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze` is the direct request/response path.
- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze/start` is the background path used by the
  React UI.
- Only one background analysis should run at a time in the intended sandbox
  deployment.
- Startup fails fast if the `analysis_jobs` storage path is unavailable or the
  required migration has not been applied.
- Trigger planning may choose layered execution or a scenario-zero
  `skip_automation` run for non-executable fixtures.

## API Surface

### Extension Catalog

- `GET /`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /searchExtension`
- `GET /getExtensionsBaseInfo`
- `GET /getExtensionsAllInfo`
- `POST /createExtension`
- `DELETE /deleteExtension`
- `GET /getExtensionScripts`
- `GET /getExtensionActivationEvents`
- `GET /getExtensionCapabilities`
- `GET /getExtensionContributesAll`
- `GET /getExtensionContributesCommands`

### Activation Reports

- `GET /api/activations`
- `GET /api/activations/latest`
- `GET /api/activations/{name}`

### Marketplace + Analysis

- `GET /api/marketplace/search`
- `POST /api/marketplace/download`
- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze`
- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze/start`
- `GET /api/marketplace/analyze/{job_id}`
- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze/{job_id}/cancel`

### Operator Settings

- `GET /api/settings/security/thresholds`
- `PUT /api/settings/security/thresholds`

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker / Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 16 compatible runtime
- Node 20+ for local UI development

### Common Commands

```bash
make install-dev
make up
make migrate
make dev
make test-local
make check-all
make test-security
make ui-types-check
make ui-boundaries
make exec-up
make exec-run
make ui-up
make sim-target TARGET=publisher.name      # target-extension smoke
make sim-all                                # UI-stimulus stress (no target ext.)
make demo-canary                            # end-to-end demo runnable canary
make demo-canary-offline                    # offline fixture validation
cd ui && npm run dev
cd ui && npm run test
.venv/bin/pytest
.venv/bin/pytest -m "not smoke and not requires_db"
.venv/bin/pytest -m "requires_db"
.venv/bin/pytest -m smoke
```

### Service Endpoints

ADR 0007 — every endpoint below binds loopback only by default. Replace
`127.0.0.1` with the operator-host LAN IP only after the
`documents/runbooks/lan-exposure.md` checklist is applied.

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Swagger: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Web UI: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- noVNC executor view: `http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html`
- CDP (debug profile only): `http://127.0.0.1:9222` — start with
  `make up-debug` or `docker compose --profile debug up`. Absent from the
  default `make up` service set.
