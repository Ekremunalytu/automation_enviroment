# ExTrace

`Last Updated: 2026-04-20`

ExTrace is a VS Code extension analysis platform built around three runtime
surfaces:

- A FastAPI API for catalog ingestion, activation report access, marketplace
  download, and sandbox analysis.
- A Dockerized executor that runs full VS Code GUI sessions under Xvfb and
  drives them with Playwright.
- A Vite + React + Tailwind analyst console that consumes the API and
  visualizes activation reports and live simulation jobs.

## Operating Model

ExTrace is intentionally designed as a single-user sandbox appliance, not a
multi-tenant web platform.

- Backend, UI, PostgreSQL, and executor are expected to run on the same machine
  or inside the same Docker host.
- The primary deployment shape is a local or lab sandbox where one analyst
  inspects one extension at a time.
- Background analysis is intentionally limited to one active job at a time.
- Activation reports remain file-backed operator artifacts under `output/`,
  while async analysis job metadata is persisted in PostgreSQL.
- If the API process restarts during an active analysis, that job is marked
  failed and should be rerun.

## Current Phase

- Week 4 stabilization closure was validated on `2026-04-20`.
- W5 security scaffolding now exists under
  `packages/analysis_contracts/detection/`, `extensions/malicious/`, and
  `tests/security/`.
- Harness-extension checksum verification is intentionally deferred as the
  first supply-chain task of W5; it is not part of the closed Week 4 scope.

## Current Architecture

The refactor introduced a canonical split between shared platform code and
workflow code:

- `appcore/`
  - Shared platform modules.
  - `api/`: settings and FastAPI dependencies.
  - `db/`: SQLAlchemy engine and session factory.
  - `storage/`: ORM models and CRUD helpers.
  - `contracts/`: shared Pydantic v2 schemas.
- `packages/`
  - Framework-agnostic contracts and analysis logic.
  - `analysis_contracts/`: backend-owned analysis contracts and the reserved
    W5 `detection/` namespace.
  - `analysis_planner/`: trigger planning logic.
  - `analysis_engine/`: reserved extraction surface for shared analysis logic.
- `workflows/`
  - Business workflows grouped by capability.
  - `extension_catalog/`: extension ingestion, parsing, and catalog endpoints.
  - `activation_reports/`: reads JSON activation reports from `output/`.
  - `marketplace/`: Marketplace search/download and sandbox analysis.
- `executor/`
  - Sandbox runtime.
  - `control.py`: workflow-visible sandbox boundary.
  - `container/`: Docker image, entrypoint, VS Code/Xvfb/noVNC boot logic.
  - `flows/playwright/`: Playwright automation helpers, entrypoint, scenario,
    and runtime-capture modules.
- `ui/`
  - Primary analyst-facing React SPA built with Vite and Tailwind.
  - `src/app/`: shell and route composition.
  - `src/features/`: `marketplace`, `reports`, `simulation`.
  - `src/lib/`: API client, adapters, generated contract types, and shared
    frontend helpers.
- `apps/`
  - Historical placeholder app stubs. These are not canonical runtime surfaces.
- `legacy_ui/`
  - Previous Streamlit implementation retained as an archival compatibility
    snapshot.

The repository now uses canonical imports only:

- Shared platform modules live under `appcore/`
- Framework-agnostic analysis logic lives under `packages/`
- Workflow code lives under `workflows/`
- Workflow-visible executor control lives under `executor/control.py`

## Request Flows

### Static Catalog Ingestion

`POST /createExtension`

1. `workflows.extension_catalog.router`
2. `workflows.extension_catalog.service`
3. `workflows.extension_catalog.manifest_reader` +
   `workflows.extension_catalog.manifest_parser`
4. `appcore.contracts.schemas`
5. `appcore.storage.crud`
6. PostgreSQL

### Marketplace Download

`POST /api/marketplace/download`

1. `workflows.marketplace.client` downloads and extracts a `.vsix`
2. `workflows.extension_catalog.service.create_extension_from_directory`
3. `appcore.storage.crud` persists validated manifest data

### Sandbox Analysis

`POST /api/marketplace/analyze` or `POST /api/marketplace/analyze/start`

1. `workflows.marketplace.router`
2. `workflows.marketplace.analysis_service`
3. `workflows.marketplace.job_service`
4. `executor.control` boundary
5. `executor.host` Docker exec wrapper
6. `executor/flows/playwright/entrypoint.py`
7. Reports written under `output/`
8. Async job metadata persisted in PostgreSQL `analysis_jobs`

Notes:

- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze` is the direct request/response path.
- `POST /api/marketplace/analyze/start` is the background path used by the
  React UI.
- Only one background analysis should run at a time in the intended sandbox
  deployment.
- Startup fails fast if the `analysis_jobs` storage path is unavailable or the
  required migration has not been applied.
- Trigger planning may choose layered execution or a scenario-zero
  `skip_automation` run for non-executable fixtures.
